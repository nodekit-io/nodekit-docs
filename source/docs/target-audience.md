description: "The nodekit-io repositories on GitHub"
---
These repositories is primarily geared at application developers who want to develop consumer and commercial applications across multiple platforms.  

The project is unopionated in the choice of front end framework and in the choice of language family as long as it preprocesses to JavaScript.

The project can be consumed just for the NKScripting engine, used with just NKScripting + NKElectro to manage the application lifecycle, or with NKScripting + NKCore to provide
a Node JS environment on device.    The default use case is to leverage all three components, NKScripting, NKElectro, NKCore, collectively known as NodeKit.
